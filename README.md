# Project Description
For this project, I will be creating an app that will allow the user to create a set of flashcards based on their desired study material. The app should allow the user to create multiple flashcards to create a deck. The app should be able to store the flashcard deck so that the user can view it again later. 
# Problem Being Addressed
 When it comes to preparing for exams, many individuals will have trouble finding effective methods to study the required material. This mobile app should provide users with a method to study exam material by allowing the user to create a deck of flashcards with terms and definitions regarding the desired study material.
# Project Platform
The app will be developed for Android devices using Android Studio. The app will be created using the Android 7.1.1 (Nougat) SDK and programmed using Java.
# Front/Back End Support
For the front-end support of the app, the user interface should be organized. Text fields and buttons should be easy to read and clearly labeled within the app. For the back-end support of the app, the created flashcard deck should be saved and stored within the app, making the previously created deck available upon app restart.
# Functionality
The home menu will have a welcome message as well as buttons to: create new flashcards, view the current flashcard deck, and an option to exit the app
The creation screen will have two text fields to enter the term and definition, as well as buttons to save the flashcard to the deck, clear the text fields, go to the view screen, and return to the home screen.
The view menu should allow users to view the flashcards in the deck. When a term is selected from a drop-down menu, a text field will display the associated definition. In the view screen, three buttons should be shown to allow the user to either return to the creation screen, clear the current flashcard deck, or return to the home screen.
